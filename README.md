Bottom of my pocket 
===================

Idea: I am a big user of Pocket, and I noticed that most of the time the long reads get stuck at the bottom. 

So what should be a reading queue inevitably become 
- part short article stack 
- part long-read graveyard

This project aims to be the graveyard of my Pocket as its content still have, to my mind, great value and could be shared, and keep my reading list as much as possible a LIFO queue.
